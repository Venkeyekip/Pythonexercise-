to describe data. XML tags are not predefined in XML. We must define our own Tags. Xml 
as itself is well readable both by human and machine. Also, it is scalable and simple to 
develop. In Android we use xml for designing our layouts because xml is lightweight 
language so it doesn’t make our layout heavy. In this article we will go through the basic 
concepts of xml in Android and different XML files used for different purpose in Android.
